### Journalism

<br>What's the progress?

# ✋ questions
When you have one

The idea is to spark discussion

notes:
  - the idea is to spark a conversation about the security of
    journalists and how we can help improve it

# Why is it important?

I guess it's easy to understand that good e

"News is something someone somewhere doesn't want printed"

-- Lord Nothcliffe

notes:
Media is incredibly important for democracy:
  - makes people aware of what is going on
  - creates accountability
  - exposes unfairness

# Under threat

![](images/bansky-grafitti.jpg)

notes:

Being under threat is nothing new for news organizations. An industry
that is based on exposing unfairness cannot go without making powerful
enemies.

Every journalist should understand that there is no such thing as
confidential digital communication. 

**None of us have confidential sources.**

<br>

--  [Alan Rusbridger, The Guardian editor](https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/rusbridger-how-no-journalists-sources-are-now-safe-joining-ipso-and-why-he-would-have-kept-news/)

### Ethical imperative:
# Source protection

notes:

Journalists' job relies on assuring source that they can preotect
their identety. If jounralists start failing at that 

Protecting sources is a moral obligation of journalists as source
often only speeak under the condition of anymoity for feal of
physical, economic of profession reprisals in reponse to their
revelations.

#### Can journalism 

## <span style="background-color: #2b9ddb; color: white"> without source protection</span>

#### really

## be called journalism

# ?

# Some examples

notes:

  Let's see some practical examples on how, because of the digital
  nature of the world surveillance of jounalists was feasible

### NSA spying on German media

notes: 

> In the summer of 2011, the CIA station chief in Berlin asked one of
the most powerful intelligence officials in Germany to go on a private
walk with him, the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reports. The
American spy had an important message to convey: one of Germany’s own
senior officials was leaking information to the press.

after that the leaker was demoted

We know about this 4 years later thanks to the Snowden leaks

### Citizenlab Report

Mexican Journalists targeted by NSO malware

# No more sources?

notes:

- Most souces are not like snowden. They don't have the knowledge of
 how to protect their communications with journalists and because of
 that.

- in a study conducted by HRW (Human Rights Watch) where 46 national
  security journalists were interviewed, they reveilld that their
  sources were less willing to talk because of the surveillance

# Threats

What are the main threats for

**investigative journalism** ?

<br>

of course it always<br>depends on the threat model<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

notes:

  But even depending on the threat model, certain threats should be
  mitigated

---

### Key problem
## Electronic evidence

1. communications are mediated
2. physical surveilance
3. weak devices

notes:
  - this classification is made by the original author of this
    presentation and not in bibliographic sources

---

### Mass surveillance

and

### Targed surveillance

example:


notes:

   investigative journalists have always been targeted by phiscall
   surveillance, but now with cheap software and hardward, with
   boundless scalability, mass surveillance is feasible.

---

## #1
### Communications are
### mediated

---

#### Metadata 

![](images/metadata-ssd.png)

Often as a consequence of *mass surveillance*

image credits: [Surveillance Self Defense, EFF](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/why-metadata-matters)

notes:
  - maybe even more imporant than the communications themselves

note:
  - > "The People Formerly Known as the Audience"
  - the famous phrase illustrates well the change in journalism
  - the defnition of journalism has broadened. The research recommends
    shifting focus from legislation about "journalism" to "acts of
    journalism" for source protection.

#### Leakage of source material


What if... Snowden docs leaked?

notes:
  - Not all should be publshed. Not all Snowden documents balance so
    well the importance to the public with the risks of
    individuals. Some things should not be published. Imagine what
    would happen if all of them got dumped like in wikileaks.

### Opening

<span style="font-size: 600%">📄</span>

notes:
  - it's an investigative journalist's job quite literally. So you
    must make sure it doesn't get in the way of journalists.

### Journalistic
### Autonomy

<br>Newsrooms offload source security 

decisions to journalists

notes:
  - from the research, newsrooms offload source security decision to
    the journalists and may not have a legacy of providing training
  - This leads to many journalists turning to free cloud services and
    tools

# Spooky action at a distance

notes:

in quantum physics they call this "spooky action at a distance". When
one thing affects another independent of the distance. It turns our
that in the privacy world a very similar mechanism exists. If one
journalistic source gets exposed, the effects propagate to everyone
and then we might see a diminishing number of sources coming to the
press.
